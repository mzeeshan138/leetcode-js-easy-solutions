## 📂 Problem List

This repository currently includes solutions for LeetCode's **easy-level** problems. Here's the breakdown:

- **9. Palindrome Number**

---

## 🎯 Problem: Palindrome Number (LeetCode 9)

### Problem Statement:

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

Example 1:  
Input: `x = 121`  
Output: `true`  
Explanation: `121` reads the same backward as forward.

Example 2:  
Input: `x = -121`  
Output: `false`  
Explanation: `-121` is not a palindrome. Reading it from right to left gives `121-`.

Example 3:  
Input: `x = 10`  
Output: `false`  
Explanation: `10` is not a palindrome since the reverse is `01`.

### 🔍 **Solution Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  ⏱️ O(log n)  
  We reverse half of the digits of the number, so the time complexity depends on the number of digits in `x`.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  💾 O(1)  
  We only use a constant amount of space to store the `reverted` number.

- **Test Cases:**  
  ✅ Passed all **11,511** hidden and sample test cases on LeetCode!
